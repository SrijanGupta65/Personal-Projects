        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p> 
            The challenge we aim to address is the <em>lack of accessible, localized resources</em> for learning about and caring for native plants in urban environments, 
            particularly in Washington. While there are apps like Planta and PicturesThis that offer general plant care tips, these resources often do <em>not cater specifically to 
            native plants</em> or the <em>unique needs of local ecosystems</em>. For example, Planta provides plant identification and care advice, but it can be <em>inaccurate</em>, 
            especially regarding <em>watering schedules</em> and <em>native species requirements</em>. Similarly, PicturesThis has a broad range of plant information but 
            <em>lacks categorization</em>, making it <em>overwhelming</em> for users who are specifically interested in native plants. This leaves a significant gap in the market 
            for a platform focused on <em>educating communities</em> about the environmental benefits of native plants, <em>how to care for them</em>, and the <em>positive impact</em> they can have on local ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem must be addressed because urban spaces in Washington are rapidly <em>losing native plants</em> due to <em>land development</em> and urban sprawl. With 
            vacant lots and <em>underutilized spaces</em>, there’s a real opportunity to restore these plants and <em>improve biodiversity</em>. However, the general public 
            <em>lacks the necessary knowledge and resources</em> to do so effectively. A user-friendly web app focused on native Washington plants would empower individuals 
            and communities to make <em>informed decisions</em>, restore ecosystems, and engage in <em>sustainable gardening practices</em>. This approach would not only promote 
            <em>ecological health</em> but also foster a stronger sense of <em>community involvement</em> and <em>environmental responsibility</em>.

        <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
        <p>
            Our app is designed specifically for Washington state residents who want to grow and care for native plants but feel overwhelmed or unsure where to start. It’s for people who already have access to gardening supplies—like soil, pots, or space—and are looking for guidance on what native plants to grow next and how to care for them. This includes beginner gardeners, students, or even families looking to turn their yards or balconies into small pockets of native greenery. A big part of this app is also making sure people with different levels of gardening experience get advice that actually fits their needs. A lot of apps out there don’t account for skill level, which can make plant care feel discouraging or confusing. This app changes that by tailoring plant recommendations and care instructions to the user’s background and goals.

        <h2>App Functionality</h2>
        <p>
            Users will interact with the app by first inputting their gardening experience, choosing between beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Based on that, the app will recommend a Washington-native plant that matches their skill level and environmental conditions (e.g., sunlight, water availability). Once a plant is selected, users will gain access to a customized timeline for harvesting or care milestones. For example, reminders for when to prune, check growth, or harvest seeds depending on the season. Users can also fill out a quick Google Form every few weeks to update their plant’s progress and upload a photo. Based on that submission, the app will respond with personalized next steps or advice, helping users troubleshoot issues and decide on the next plant to try.
        </p>
        <p>
            All plant data will come from local, trusted sources like the <a href = "https://www.wnps.org/plant-lists">Washington Native Plant Society’s plant directory</a>, which includes details on habitat, growth requirements, and seasonal needs. The information will be organized in a way that’s easy to understand, with clean visuals, care checklists, and beginner-friendly tips. The app is designed to feel less like a textbook and more like a supportive guide that meets you where you are.
